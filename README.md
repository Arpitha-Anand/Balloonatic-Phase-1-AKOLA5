# Hi, I am Arpitha Kolar Anand
* I am pursuing my master's in computer science at university of new haven. This is my first semester here and I am very passionate in designing and developing web applications.

* The project is developing a website where they design and decorate the venue for events using balloons. Customer can view the design and price. They can order the design of their choice.

*  In phase-1, We have designed the website using HTML, CSS, and basics of javascript. There ia a home page which buttons redirecting to different pages. There is a product page where customer can select balloons and decors for a reasonable price. About page for company information, A contact page that has company details like address, contact number, etc,.

* In the future I am planning to add more javascript functionalities and make the website more responsive.
I am planning to try different designs and explore while doing the project.
